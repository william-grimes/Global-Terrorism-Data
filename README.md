Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist events around the world from 1970 through 2014. Some portion of the attacks have not been attributed to a particular terrorist group.

This model uses a random forest ensemble trained on known groups to predict which groups may be responsible where the group is unknown. Features included the attack type, and weapons used.
